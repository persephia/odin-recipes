    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 spoonful sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>5 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg for wash</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First we will activate the yeast in a separate mixture.  Add 1 cup of warm water to a small bowl or Pyrex and add 1 spoonful of sugar.  Measure and add 2 tbsp of active dry yeast and allow the mixture to sit for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add 5 cups of all purpose flour.  Add 1 tsp of salt, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/4 cup honey, and 2 eggs.  Lightly mix.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture to the rest of the ingredients.  Mix until a dough is formed.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the bowl.  Lightly flour a worktop and knead the dough until smooth, which should take between 8 and 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place your dough in a bowl and cover with a towel.  Leave the dough to prove for 2 hours.  The dough should roughly double in size.</li>
        <li>Briefly work the dough and divide it into thirds.  Roll each section into a long strand and plait the three strands to form a loaf.</li>
        <li>Place the loaf on a baking tray and leave to rest for an hour.  The loaf should expand in size.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 375F and apply an egg wash to the exterior of the loaf with a pastry brush.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
